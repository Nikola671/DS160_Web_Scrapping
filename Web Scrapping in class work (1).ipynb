    "#The source of the image, table, and text are from Wikipedia *List of US States and Territories by GDP*, which gave insight into how much each US State preforms economically compared to 2024 from 2022. The image that was extracted is a color-coded map of the US with states in darker shades of red having higher nominal GDP and lighter shades of red for states with lower nominal GDP. From the image, it can be infered which states stand with the highest nominal GDP contributions and which states contributed the least. From the table extracted, the same conclusion can be made; however, with the table's data adding monetary values to attribute to each state, it can be further obsered that California has the highest GDP from 2022 and 2024, but Texas has higher rate of growth between those two years. This is an inference one could not have made by solely analyzing the image. The text extracted gives overview of the data the image and table provide, while also giving additional information like total amounts from states' collective data. The biggest challenge faced during extraction was displaying the desired image in the notebook. The remedy discoved was assigning the url of the desired image to a variable, and then displaying that specific image from the list of images collected from the source. "
